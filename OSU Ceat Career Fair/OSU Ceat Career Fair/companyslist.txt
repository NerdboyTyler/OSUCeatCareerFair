ECI established a small office in Billings, Montana to continue to serve the electric utility and industrial clients the firm had worked with for more than 25 years. The company has grown significantly since its humble beginnings and currently employs 370 professional engineers, surveyors and technical staff performing project design work throughout the United States and abroad.<enter><enter>Operating from ten major regional offices from coast to coast, ECI has expanded its presence as one of the country's leading T&D consulting design firms.

Some of the first projects undertaken by EPC were the construction of fiber optic regeneration sites for long haul, high bandwidth communications. However, changing market demands quickly resulted in the steady growth of EPC Services for traditional utility projects as well as major industrial loads having customer-owned facilities. Because of this, EPC has quickly grown from a small company to one of the very largest specialty Engineer-Procure-Construct companies in the United States.� <enter><enter>ECI's motto of "Engineering with Distinction" is not only meant as a sign of commitment to our clients but also serves as a reminder to our staff that distinction comes from being innovative, and innovation combined with quality keeps you at the forefront of the pack. </description>
